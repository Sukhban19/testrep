
Dear 

In order to fulfil your duties you may be issued with Virgin Media Company equipment. You must keep the equipment in good condition. On leaving your assignment with Virgin Media, you must return the equipment in good order to a Company site. Failure to do so could result in you being liable for the total cost of its replacement.


It is your responsibility to keep such equipment secure and in the condition in which it was provided to you. If any item of equipment is lost, stolen or damaged you may be required to cover the cost of replacing the item and agree, should Virgin Media request, that Hays may deduct such amounts from any future payments due for work completed on your Assignment. 

Should Virgin Media need to recover an item belonging to them (such as a laptop), which you have been unable to return to them either during or after your Assignment, you agree that Hays may pass on details of your home address to Virgin Media for the arrangement of a courier / next steps.
